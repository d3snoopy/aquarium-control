Top TODO:

- Ping host on more than just "update"?
- Bug: when removing profile from a source, profile is removed from all sources.
- Implement non-variable channels
- Implement Reactions
- Implement Triggers
- Update/Complete Help
- Update Configure page to add profile editing.
- Facilitate time picking
- Scheduler work (an app that updates profiles based on things like sunrise/sunset data)
- Update host code to drop requests where an ID doesn't successfully come across
- Add in section scrolls for the page so when you edit to goes there.
- Home page improvement; driven channel status (one grouped plot per host?)
- Check into how increating a new profile seriously breaks things by hitting enter
- Error where future date sometimes results on host (but not channel) ???? Don't remember/document error better
- Adding a new profile adds all channels of type (not just ones that are associated)  ???? Don't remember/document error better
- Implement grouping of channels
- Fix the common data plot where it just does everything without groupings
