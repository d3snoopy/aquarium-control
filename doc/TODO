Top TODO:

- Ping host on more than just "update"?
- Implement non-variable channels
- Implement Reactions
- Implement Triggers
- Update/Complete Help
- Update Configure page to add channel-wise profile time offset.
- Scheduler work (an app that updates profiles based on things like sunrise/sunset data)
- Update host code to drop requests where an ID doesn't successfully come across
- Check into how in creating a new profile seriously breaks things by hitting enter
- Bugfix: non-variable channels with variable source inputs don't create new points to "toggle" at inflection point; instead each point is simply cast to min or max... so if there's a time delay between a min and a max it appears as a linear slope over the time.  Note: the host arduino code could take care of this... also, it doesn't make much sense to feed non-variable channels with variable inputs, but as of right now it behaves slightly diffferent then you would expect.

Hardware needs:

Make glass cleaner (or try)
Make pumps/current things
Auto feeder?
Auto top off?
