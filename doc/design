Overall design:

Server:
Handles comms to each host
Coordinates the actions between the hosts
Note: the hosts "check in" the whole time, on an interval.

Host Comms:
Hosts should receive and send info in plaintext, with comma separated values in the specified order.
The message parsing is extremely simple in the interest of preserving memory on the hosts.
Note: for all values, quotes (' or ") and commas are illegal.
Also note: comms happen one channel at a time, it's expected that the host will loop through all of its channels.

Message format out to the server, in the form of the POST strings:
Note: "host" and "HMAC" post strings are required.  Strings are enclosed with double quotes.  Trailing commas are okay

# "host" POST string:

string "id", #Generate a random uuid for this
string "name", #Human-readable string
int date, #LinuxDate of the ping; used to prevent replay attacks
int maxVals, #Maximum number of values that the server should send
int chanNum, #The number of the channel we're working with, starting at 0.
string "chanName", #Channel Name
string "chanType", #Human-readable; channels must be of a common type to be within a common source
int chanVariable, #true: values scale, false: values is either 0 or 1
int chanActive, #true: connected to something, false: exists, but unused
float chanMax, #applies to variable: maximum number the channel will accept
float chanMin, #minimum number the channel will accept
string "chancolor", #hex color string, minus the #
string "chanunits", #human readable representation of units (units in which it expects values)


# "time" POST string: #Timestamps for data for the channel we're working tih
int time1,
int time2,
...
int timen,

# "data" POST string: #Data associated with the timestamps
float data1,
float data2,
...
float datan,

Note: any "time" needs a paired "data", so the two messages will have the same number of items.


# "HMAC" POST string: SHA-256 HMAC of the concatenation of the "host", "time", and "data" post strings.
# Important note: This does not include the "host=" or "&time=", etc. found in the HTMP message.
# If the HTML message were: "host=a&time=1,2,&data=4,5," you would want to hash "a1,2,4,5,".

Note: hosts are going to need to get a time hack before the server will accept anything from them:
The server will not accept decreasing "date" values. In order to allow multiple pings in a row for multiple channels, it will accept the same date multiple times from a host, but not as applied to a channel.
So, a host can ping multiple times within a second, but the channel must be different each time.

Return from the server, in the form of a page of data.

First line: Reserved for debug messages #Returned regardless of hash/time
Second line: empty
Third line: The data, all in a single string: Data applies to the channel of the host POST.

int date, # Linux time status, host will check to make sure this is greater than seen before, always returned.
int nextPing, # Server wish next time the controller should check in (Note: host may check in again earlier than this)
int inInterval, #Internal in seconds to perform reads
int outInterval, #Interval in seconds to output controls (Note: linear interpolate between data points)
"time", #Flag that we're giving timestamps for channel 1 - make sure to include the double quotes.
int time1,
int time2,
...
int timen,
"data", #Flag that we're now giving values to pair to the timestamps.
float data1,
float data2,
....
float datan,
"HMAC",
HMAC # HMAC of the data: from the first character of the line to the "," immediately before "HMAC".


Note: only date is returned if the incoming message was validated (known host, good HMAC, newer time)





Server design:
index.php: starting location
quickstart.php: a startup wizard
host.php: the page by which the server communicates with hosts

status.php: the page showing status of all of the stuff
configure.php: the page to set up all of the stuff once it's connected/accepted
setup.php: the page to add hosts to the system and configure their basic properties
help.php: a page to help people get oriented

model/ : functions to handle the DB interactions
    model.php: basic db stuff: connect, reset, disconect, etc.
    hostFn.php: functions in support of host.php
    statusFn.php: functions in support of status.php
    ...Fn.php: functions in support of ....php
    setupFn.php: functions in support of setup.php
    
template/ : header, footer, etc. to include as part of paiting the pages in a uniform style

test/ : test functions to support development

../static/ : jss/css/pictures/etc.
