Add a category type for the devices, so we can segregate lights, fans, dosers, etc.
Add some presets?

Check out security for the db and static and stuff

Add: Auto-schedule on things
Add: More security
Remove: Inputs in schdctl

Add: two more apps:
ReactiveCtrl - for things that react to inputs
Sensors - inputs from types of hardware sensors & logging
Other inputs?

Add: "Total Power" plot for groups of channels.

Mechanism to consume PWM channels/BBB resources

Add: are you sure dialog for the delete button.



Organization:

Hardware:  (Do hardware resources?)
    Inputs  (currently inputctl)
    Outputs  (currently hardware)

Controls:
    Schedules (currently schdctl)
    Reactions (TODO)



Hardware needs:

Add a temp sensor to light
Add an inverter to PWM output, so defaults to off
[Optional logic inversion for all?]
